# What is `helmet.js` Used for in Node.js Applications?

`helmet.js` is a middleware package for Node.js, commonly used in Express applications to reduce security risks related to HTTP headers. It acts as a shield for web applications by applying default security best practices. Below are the main uses of `helmet.js`:

## Primary Uses of `helmet.js`

`helmet.js` helps mitigate vulnerabilities by adjusting HTTP headers. Here are its core features:

### 1. Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - Adds security headers like `Content-Security-Policy` to control which scripts, styles, and resources can load. This prevents malicious JavaScript from being executed in the browser.

### 2. Protect Against Clickjacking
   - Sets the `X-Frame-Options` header to prevent your website from being embedded in an `<iframe>`. This defends against clickjacking attacks.

### 3. Hide Technology Details
   - Removes the `X-Powered-By` header, which often reveals "Express" or other technologies, making it harder for attackers to identify potential vulnerabilities.

### 4. Prevent MIME-Type Sniffing
   - Sets the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header to ensure browsers handle files only according to their specified `Content-Type`. This protects against attacks with manipulated file types.

### 5. Enforce Secure Connections (HTTPS)
   - Adds the `Strict-Transport-Security` header, instructing browsers to always access the app via HTTPS. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 6. Defend Against DNS Rebinding Attacks
   - Sets headers like `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control` to address vulnerabilities related to DNS rebinding.

## How to Use `helmet.js`

### Installation
```bash
npm install helmet
```

### Basic Usage in Express
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const helmet = require('helmet');

const app = express();

// Enable Helmet
app.use(helmet());

// Define a route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, secure world!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000');
});
```

### Modular Configuration

`helmet.js` provides a modular API, allowing you to enable only specific security measures. For example:

#### Custom Configuration Example
```javascript
app.use(
  helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: false, // Disable CSP if not needed
    frameguard: { action: 'deny' }, // Prevent clickjacking
    hidePoweredBy: true, // Remove X-Powered-By header
    xssFilter: true, // Enable XSS protection
  })
);
```
